# Server Manager

## How to use

The commands to control the Server Manager are:

- `start-server-manager` starts the Server Manager in the background
- `attach-to-server-manager` attaches the console to the Server Manager tmux session allowing to visualize the status of the Server Manager
- `Ctrl+B, D` detaches the console from the Server Manager tmux session
- `kill-all-robot-servers` kills all the running Robot Servers and the Server Manager
- `kill-server-manager` kills the Server Manager
- `restart-server-manager` kills all the running Robot Servers and the Server Manager and starts the Server Manager in the background

## Testing 

Start the Server Manager and attach to the session with: 

```sh
start-server-manager && attach-to-server-manager
```
Expected output:

```sh
2021-XX-XX XX:XX:XX,XXX - serverManager - INFO - Server Manager started at 50100
```

If you get: `start-server-manager: command not found` it is most probably because your `$PATH` is not set correctly, to fix the problem add:

```bash
export PATH="/home/<your_username>/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

to your `.bashrc` file. 

## Troubleshooting

The Server Manager starts the Robot Server/s in a [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session. To access the session of the Robot Server, first connect to the tmux server with:
```sh
tmux -L ServerManager 
```
Then navigate to the session with `Ctrl+b  )`
